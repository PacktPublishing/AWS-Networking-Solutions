## About the Video Course
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

The video course includes a series of tutorials to help users become fluent in a variety of networking aspects for Amazon Web Services' public cloud offering. The content is geared towards practical exercises that demonstrate important concepts.
Each tutorial builds on the previous one, the result being a connected, secure multi-VPC configuration. You will learn how to configure a VPC and create subnets for different use cases. This course introduces the basics of AWS networking; our main goal is to reach intermediate users who are looking for better AWS networking examples. The course supplies multiple Microsoft Windows examples because most AWS literature is Linux-focused.
